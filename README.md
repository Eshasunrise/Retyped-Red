# Retyped-Red
A Disassembly-based Romhack made to rebalance Pokemon Red

This was made using the Pokered Disassembly with bits of code taken from Pokeyellow and jojobear13's ShinPokered

It aims to rebalance Pokemon Red by introducing the three new types (Fairy, Dark, and Steel) and re-applying them to different Pokemon. More info can be found on the PokeCommunity forum page in the link below.

To play the hack, you can download the ips patches at https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=451539 and apply them to your own USA copy of Pokemon Red or Blue.

Many thanks to the people of the devs of the Pokered and Pokeyellow disassembly for making this possible, the community of Pokecommunity for providing tools and tips to new programmers, and special thanks to Lunos for helping me use Cygwin and GitHub! Please enjoy, and feel free to leave criticism and suggestions!
