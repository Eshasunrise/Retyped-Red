Adjust XP gain
Add Post-Game E4 & Champion Upgrades (Xtra hard based on balance critiques)
Add more moves
Remake hack entirely using Shin-Pokered (Vanilla) as a base (wanna keep some bugs tho)
Adjust any overly broken Pokemon post-test (Other than Mewtwo)
Choose a sixth Non-Legendary Ice-type (Make Cloyster Steel if I can find a seventh)
Justify making Kangaskhan a Dragon
Figure out WTF Lickitung is supposed to be
Make X and Y harder (but still not very hard)
My own Pokemon game???
